# Adaptive-Drone-Noise-Filtering
Implements Normalized LMS (NLMS) adaptive filtering to isolate drone-like noise from live microphone recordings using a reference template.
Why Filters Matter: Signal cleaning, shaping, feature extraction, system modeling.
How it Works: Adaptive filter updates weights automatically until the reference drone noise is suppressed/extracted.
